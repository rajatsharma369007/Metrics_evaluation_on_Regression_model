# Metrics evaluation on Regression_model

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have showed how to use different evaluation metrics on regressor model
* mean absolute error
* mean squared error
* r2 score

## Dataset
I have loaded the dataset from sklearn's dataset package.  
<code>from sklearn.datasets import load_boston</code>

## Installation
* Numpy  
<code>conda install numpy</code>
* Scikit learn  
<code>conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn</code>

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
